# Project Progress Checklist

## Phase 1: Project Setup & Foundation

- [X] Initial project planning and tool analysis
- [ ] Create project directory structure (Main folder `ai-crypto-agent` assumed to exist)
    - [ ] Create `src` directory for core logic
    - [ ] Create `scripts` directory for utility scripts
    - [ ] Create `data` directory (for local data, with .gitignore)
    - [ ] Create `tests` directory
- [X] Create `readme.md`
- [X] Create `tech-stack.md`
- [X] Create `progress-checklist.md`
- [ ] Initialize Git repository in `C:\Users\Mr.Kale\ai-crypto-agent`
- [ ] Create GitHub repository and push initial files
- [ ] Define `.gitignore` file

## Phase 2: Data Acquisition & Processing

- [ ] **Web Scraping Module**
    - [ ] Identify key news sources (e.g., Cointelegraph, CoinDesk, Decrypt) and BTC event trackers (e.g., conference schedules, halving counters).
    - [ ] Implement basic news fetching using Exa/Playwright tools for 2-3 sources.
    - [ ] Develop parsers to extract relevant text (headline, body, date).
- [ ] **Sentiment Analysis**
    - [ ] Choose and integrate an NLP library for sentiment analysis (e.g., VADER, Hugging Face Transformers).
    - [ ] Process extracted text to get sentiment scores.
- [ ] **Knowledge Graph Integration (`mcp_servers_*`)**
    - [ ] Design initial KG schema (Entities: NewsArticle, Event, Asset, SentimentScore; Relations: mentionsAsset, hasSentiment, occursOnDate).
    - [ ] Implement functions to add scraped news, events, and sentiment scores to the KG.

## Phase 3: AI Decision-Making Core

- [ ] **Decision Framework (`mcp_clear-thought_decisionframework`)**
    - [ ] Define inputs: News sentiment, event proximity/impact, (later: technical indicators, market trends).
    - [ ] Define options: Buy, Sell, Hold, Strong Buy, Strong Sell.
    - [ ] Define criteria and weights for decision making.
    - [ ] Implement logic to query KG for inputs to the decision framework.
- [ ] **Agent Workflow (`mcp_clear-thought_sequentialthinking`)**
    - [ ] Define the main loop: Fetch Data -> Process Data -> Update KG -> Analyze -> Decide -> (Log/Simulate Trade).
- [ ] **Confidence & Monitoring (`mcp_clear-thought_metacognitivemonitoring`)**
    - [ ] Implement checks for data quality/staleness.
    - [ ] Allow the agent to report confidence in its decisions.

## Phase 4: Trading Simulation & Interface

- [ ] **Trading Simulation**
    - [ ] Implement a paper trading module (simulates trades without real money).
    - [ ] Log simulated trades, P&L.
- [ ] **Exchange API Interface Design**
    - [ ] Define a generic interface for trading functions (get_balance, place_order, get_order_status).
    - [ ] (User Task) Implement concrete classes for target exchanges using their APIs.

## Phase 5: Dockerization & Core Agent Structure

- [ ] Create `requirements.txt` with all Python dependencies.
- [ ] Develop `main.py` (or similar entry point) for the agent.
- [ ] Create `Dockerfile` to package the agent.
    - [ ] Ensure it handles environment variables for API keys (user needs to manage these securely).
- [ ] Build and test the Docker image locally.
- [ ] Write initial Docker run commands in `readme.md`.

## Phase 6: Testing, Refinement & Advanced Features

- [ ] **Backtesting Framework** (if feasible with available data)
    - [ ] Develop or integrate a simple backtesting capability.
- [ ] **Technical Indicators** (Optional)
    - [ ] Research and integrate libraries for TA (e.g., TA-Lib, Pandas TA).
    - [ ] Add TA results as input to the decision framework and KG.
- [ ] **Error Handling & Logging**
    - [ ] Implement robust logging throughout the application.
    - [ ] Implement comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms.

## Phase 7: Documentation & Finalization

- [ ] Update `readme.md` with comprehensive setup, configuration, and usage instructions.
- [ ] Document core modules and functions.
- [ ] Review and finalize all project documentation.
