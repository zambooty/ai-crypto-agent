# AI Crypto Trading Agent

This project aims to create a smart AI-powered cryptocurrency trading agent that makes decisions based on web-scraped news, market events, and other relevant data. The agent is designed to run locally using Docker.

## Features (Planned)

*   Automated web scraping for crypto news and events.
*   Sentiment analysis of gathered information.
*   AI-driven decision-making for trading.
*   Integration with cryptocurrency exchanges (to be implemented by the user).
*   Knowledge graph for storing and reasoning about market information.
*   Dockerized for easy deployment and management.

## Getting Started

(Instructions to be added as the project progresses, including setup, dependencies, and running the agent.)

## Web Application

The project includes a Flask-based web application with the following features:

*   **Dashboard (`/`)**: Displays the current status of the trading bot, performance charts (placeholder), and an activity log (placeholder).
*   **Build a Bot (`/build-bot`)**: A page dedicated to configuring new trading bots. Users can specify:
    *   Bot Name
    *   Cryptocurrency to trade (e.g., BTC, ETH)
    *   Data sources for web scraping (e.g., Cointelegraph, CoinDesk, CoinMarketCal)
    *   Scraping interval (in minutes)
    *   Trading strategy (placeholder)
